## Umich-Master-Codes

### Programming Language

* Mostly are MATLAB and Python.

### Warning

* This is like a storage repository that saves most of my written codes for all courses I took at UMich, so do not use it for any purpose, especially when you are also an Umich student.

### Why I create this repo ?

* Just for reference when I need them. Or to re-activate my memory for some specific problems.

### Notes

* Simulink models, pdf, documents,... are NOT included in this repo because of privacy.
